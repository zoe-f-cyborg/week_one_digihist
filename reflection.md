# What did I think digital history is, prior to this course?
An ooffshoot of the digital humanities focusing on historical material. 
Perhaps also the history of the internet and digital tools. 

# What do I think digital history is, after week one?
A field of history which makes use of digital tools to amass, share, and examine historical material, 
not limited to the recent history of the internet. 
For example the [William Blake Archive](http://www.blakearchive.org/new-window/enlargement/songsie.n?descId=songsie.n.illbk.01),
 or the oft-mentioned [Orlando Project](http://orlando.cambridge.org/), or [this fantastic map of early modern london](https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/agas.htm).

This week's material focused a lot on the idealogical backdrop of the field of digital history. 
Instead of being given a clear and simple definition of digital history, I was invited into the realm of questioning.
This was interesting, but also disorienting. I look forward to filling in this rough sketch in the weeks to come. 

In terms of my personal goals for this course and "where I want to go" with digital history, I do not know yet. 
My general interests can be detected in what I chose to bookmark in my "interesting-links.md" page. 
I think broadly, I want to familiarize myself more with the different tools of digital scholarship, and stop fearing technical jargon.
