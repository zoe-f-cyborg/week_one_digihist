Hello professor, I am having trouble figuring out how to use Github.
Specifically, I think I may need help learning how to format text.
When I try to break a line of text in the editing stage, those lines disappeare in the fianl display (as you can see from this atrocious block of text befroe you). 
I have found there are differences in the way text is displayed depending on things like if it is in a comment, in the repository description, or in a file not ending in ".md"
However, I am still unfimiliar with a lot of the vocabulary of both your and the website's guides, and this is making my progress rather slow.
