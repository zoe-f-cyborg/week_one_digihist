Hello professor, I am having trouble figuring out how to use Github.
Specifically, I think I may need help learning how to format text.
When I try to break a line of text in the editing stage, those lines disappeare in the fianl display (as you can see from this atrocious block of text befroe you). 
I have found there are differences in the way text is displayed depending on things like if it is in a comment, in the repository description, or in a file not ending in ".md"
However, I am still unfimiliar with a lot of the vocabulary of both your and the website's guides, and this is making my progress rather slow. 

UPDATE: I figured it out! Ultimately not through guides, but throuhg comparing my code to the example code on the website and experimenting to realize...

That the way to do it is just to press return **twice** instead of once.
