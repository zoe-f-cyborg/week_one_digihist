Some links which I found useful in week one:

["mastering markdown"](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

+ [a guide for formating text specifically](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github#text-formatting-toolbar)

[markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
