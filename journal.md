# Week One Journal -- Challenges and Triumphs 

Most of this week one material was pretty easy, at least in terms of set-up. 
The guides made everything relatively easy. 
Next week will be the real challenge, of retaining what i've learned and making use of these new resources.

The most difficult thing for me was the rush of new vocabulary, especially in relation to Github. 
I will get the hang of this as we continue making us of and contextualizing these new words. 

I do find— and this is a challenge which is really broader than this particular class— that my focus in 
most work-from-home tasks waxes much more quickly than when I have structured lectures to attend, and which ignite my focus. 
This problem certainly effected my productivity in performing a lot of the tasks for week one, especially reading the articles.
I should have done this first, to familiarize myself with the subject matter, but instead I help off to last. 
Once I actually read them, I felt a lot more motivated for the class. 


## Hypothesis
I’m very interested in this application! I can see it being very useful but I also worry that I may be overusing it right now. 
When reading a pdf or any word doc where highlighting is an option, 
I tend to use it excessively, highlighting all the names an a sentence in almost every paragraph. 
I find this helps me focus and makes it easier to skim later. 
But I imagine it might be annoying for other readers. 
In the future I will probably be doing less of that, as as far as I can tell every highlight 
(not just the "post to public" annotations) are visible to everyone.
On the plus side, there is always the hide view function. 


## Discord
Extremely helpful and looks like it will hopefully be a fun place to hang out and socialize! 
The atmosphere feels more relaxed I think largely on account of it being a website many associate 
with leisure activities and which they already feel comfortable using. 
I’ve only used it briefly before the play DND and when i wanted to try to get involved with extinction rebellion’s ottawa branch, a project I quickly abandoned. 
Returning to it now, I’m beginning to appreciate the architecture of it, the way it makes use of coding language, the simple functionality of it. 


## Github 
Probably the most challenging application for me personally to wrap my head around. 
I got overwhelmed by the vocabulary and most of the people chatting about it in discord already seemed to know what they were doing (at least, moreso than me). 
With most coding tasks, I find them very difficult to talk about (the vocabulary overwhelming, and necessary for precision) 
but quite rewarding and satisfying to actually do. 
I will have to try to be better about learning the vocabulary so that I can actually talk to my peers about what I'm doing, 
and get help from them instead of just staring at my screen for 20 minutes blankly. 

When Teddy uploaded her assignment submission to the Discord it really helped me understand what specifically was being asked of us. 

The youtube videos on the website were also quite helpful. 

Generally, just *seeing* what things were supposed to actually look like was helpful. 


## Zotero
I understand why this is useful in theory, and I've heard it mentioned by profs before, but I admit that, 
although I went through all the steps requested, it will take a bit more nudging for me to actually start making full use of this app. 
Hopefully by the end of the semester I will have amassed enough experience with this extension that it will no longer be a challenge. 

This is also the app with the highest potential to come in handy in my future and in my other classes, so I'm going to try to actually make use of it (even if the initial learning stage feels unproductive).
