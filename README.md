# week_one_digihist
Repository of all week one github work for my digital history class (hopefully, assuming I do everything right) 
So far so good. I'm Zoe, I am... in this class... I rickrolled the prof... nothing else really going for me at this point
I would have had this set up sooner, but I (to be frank) got lazy.
