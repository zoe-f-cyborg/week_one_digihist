# week_one_digihist
This will be the repository of all week one github work for my digital history class (hopefully, assuming I do everything right). 

So far so good. I'm Zoe, I am... in this class... I rickrolled the prof... nothing else really going for me at this point. 

I would have had this set up sooner, but I (to be frank) got lazy.
